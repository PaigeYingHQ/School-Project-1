# School-Project-1
* This project includes all the work we've done in the competition of DM which was hold by my university.
* The final Submission are composed of three R scripts and a paper
* Three R scripts are feature, rf and xgb, each of them represents a part of work that is described in our paper
* And they should be executed in the order of feature, rf and xgb
* Of course the data is expected to be restored in the same fold with these scripts.
